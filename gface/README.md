# Gundam Face Prediction Application



Sample application is published on [my blog](https://www.scpepper.tokyo/2019/03/27/post-269/).

If you use the sample application, you upload image file focused on the gundam face and the shape of image file should be square.



Now, the model predict the input image to RX-178, MSZ-006 or RX-93. 

But the accuracy is not good. The cause is considered to be a data set collected from google search and shaped manually.
